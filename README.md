# Enumerator-OOP-

At every competition of the National Angling Championship, the results of the
competitors were recorded and put into a text file. Every line of the file contains the name
of the angler the ID of the competition (string without spaces), and the species and the
size of the caught fishes (pair of a string without spaces and a natural number). Data is
separated by space or tab. The lines of the file are ordered by the name of the anglers.
The file is assumed to be in the correct form. Sample line in the file:
Peter LAC0512 carp 45 carp 53 catfish 96
(1) How many lines there are in the file where catfish is caught?
(2) Is there an angler who has caught catfish on all of his contests?
